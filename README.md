splinetree
==========

This package allows users to create, visualize, and evaluate regression trees and random forests for longitudinal or functional data through a spline projection method first suggested by Yu and Lambert (1999). 

Example
-------

``` r
#library(splinetree)
#tree1 <- splineTree(BMI ~ HISP + WHITE + BLACK + HGC_MOTHER + SEX, BMI ~ AGE, "ID", nlsySample, degree = 1, intercept = FALSE, cp = 0.005)
#R2 = R2_projected(tree1)
#stPlots(tree1)
#treeSummary(tree1)
```
