  abstract = {This article reports results from a longitudinal study investigating the effects of low-to-moderate prenatal and postnatal lead exposure on the cognitive development of children during the first 18 months of life. Study hypotheses are expressed as a sequence of linear models for the outcome variable adjusted score on the Bayley Scales of Mental Development (MDIA), as a function of cord blood-lead concentration, infant blood-lead concentration at semiannual examinations, and other characteristics of study participants. These models are fitted to MDIA measurements on three occasions for as many as 214 infants, first assuming an arbitrary multivariate covariance structure for the repeated measurements and then with covariance structure arising from a random-effects model for errors. Estimates of the effects of lead exposure are not sensitive to the assumed covariance structure. The article describes several approaches to residual analysis and outlier detection in the longitudinal setting. In particular, it shows how empirical Bayes residuals can be used to estimate the partial regression coefficient of covariates not included in the linear model. The major findings concerning the effect of lead exposure on cognitive development are (a) a clear association between cord blood-lead concentration and Bayley scores in the first 18 months of life, (b) no clear evidence of an effect of cumulative postnatal exposure, and (c) a tendency for children who had higher lead concentrations at 6 months of age to exhibit poorer performance at 18 months than children with low lead concentrations. These findings have implications for acceptable blood-lead concentrations in children and pregnant women.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human evidence on the effects of early life phthalate exposure on obesity and cardiovascular disease risks, reported by experimental studies, is limited to a few cross-sectional studies.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and childhood growth and blood pressure in a Spanish birth cohort study.
METHODS: We assessed exposure using the average of two phthalate metabolite spot-urine concentrations collected from the mothers in the first and third pregnancy trimesters (creatinine-adjusted, n = 391). Study outcomes were the difference in age- and sex-specific z-scores for weight between birth and 6 months of age; and repeated age- and sex-specific z-scores for body mass index (BMI) at 1, 4, and 7 years; waist-to-height ratio at 4 and 7 years; and age- and height-specific z-scores for systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 4 and 7 years.
RESULTS: The sum of five high-molecular-weight phthalate metabolites ($\Sigma$HMWPm) was associated with lower weight z-score difference between birth and 6 months ($\beta$ per doubling of exposure = -0.41; 95\% CI: -0.75, -0.06) and BMI z-scores at later ages in boys ($\beta$ = -0.28; 95\% CI: -0.60, 0.03) and with higher weight z-score difference ($\beta$ = 0.24; 95\% CI: -0.16, 0.65) and BMI z-scores in girls ($\beta$ = 0.30; 95\% CI: -0.04, 0.64) (p for sex interaction = 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). The sum of three low-molecular-weight phthalates ($\Sigma$LMWPm) was not significantly associated with any of the growth outcomes. $\Sigma$HMWPm and $\Sigma$LMWPm were associated with lower systolic blood pressure z-scores in girls but not in boys.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that prenatal phthalate exposure may be associated with postnatal growth and blood pressure in a sex-specific manner. Inconsistencies with previous cross-sectional findings highlight the necessity for evaluating phthalate health effects in prospective studies.},
