# splinetree

This package allows users to create, visualize, and evaluate regression trees and random forests for longitudinal or functional data through a spline projection method first suggested by Yu and Lambert (1999). 

## Installation

You can install splinetree from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anna-neufeld/splinetree")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(splinetree)
tree <- splineTree(~HISP+WHITE+BLACK+HGC_MOTHER+SEX, BMI ~ AGE, "ID", nlsySample, degree = 1, intercept = FALSE, cp = 0.005)
stPlot(tree)
stPrint(tree)
projectedR2(tree)
```
